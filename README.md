### The game components
- [x] Board *(manages the game board i.e. grid of cells)*
- [x] Piece *(manages a single tetromino piece; each piece covers 4 game board cells)*
- [x] RandomPieceGenerator *(randomly generates next piece during game)*
### The AI
- [x] AI_Player *(selects next move based on best score using given set of paremeters)*
- [x] GA_ParametersGenerator *(generates optimal set of parameters using a genetic algorithm)*
### Putting both parts together
- [x] TetrisAI *(Simulates game being played by the AI; uses pygame to render components)*
